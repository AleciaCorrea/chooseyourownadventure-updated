        <h1>Result: BRUTAL ENDING</h1>
        <p>Curiosity and hunger gets the best of you as you decide to follow the berry trail up north. After scaling the hilly area for some time, you discover a fresh blueberry bush and start to eat frantically. With all the rustling of the bush, you fail to hear an animal approach behind you. When you stop searching for berries, you turn around and look down to see a honey badger. Thinking the animal was cute, you bend down to offer it berries. Before you could take action, the badger quickly grabs a hold of your fingers in its mouth and makes its way to attack your whole body. Severely injured, you could not recieve medical attention in time, also resulting in death soon after the attack. </p>
