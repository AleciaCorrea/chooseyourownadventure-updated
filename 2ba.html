You hesitantly advance onto the trail and eventually hear a faint noise, almost mechanical. Following the voice, you find the pilot alone, sitting on the floor with a radio in her hand. Alas, you have found another survivor. Excited to see you, the pilot exclaims that she sent out a radio signal for help, however, the help will come the next day. You have found a comrade, however now you and the pilot need to survive one night in the forest. </p>
