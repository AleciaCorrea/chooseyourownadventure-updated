        <h1>Result: BAD ENDING</h1>
        <p>Following the small animal tracks, you eventually discover a small den which looks like it belongs to some badgers. You kneel down to look inside to see if anyone is home. Salivating, the thought of eating a small animal doesnt phase you anymore. As you keep trying to look inside you hear a rattle in your ear. Turning your head, you find a rattlesnake meeting your eye contact. Before you have time to react, the snake lunges and wraps its jaws around your neck, which poisons you, leading to death soon after. Turns out the snake was looking for a meal as well. </p>
